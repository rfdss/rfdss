Hi👋 I'm a software developer with ~9 years of real experience, but I started to learn software development at the end of 2011. First of all, I learn VB6 (Visual Basic) and Delphi to make game hacking. Next, I've been loved to software development and I started to learn C/C++, primitive types, pointers, memory manipulation and basic assembly. Around 2015 during college, I started my professional career. Since then, I've been working on projects like - digital agency, startups (CX, fintech), cybersecurity company, e-commerce and software house focused on mobile applications. I'm diving into full-stack challenges, but I can also specialise when needed.
